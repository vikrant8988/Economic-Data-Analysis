# Global Economic Report

## Project Overview
The Global Economic Report aims to analyze economic data across various countries to understand the relationships between key indicators such as life expectancy, GDP, and electricity consumption. This project provides insights into how these factors interrelate and contribute to national development.

## Objectives
- **Data Analysis**: Explore and analyze data to derive meaningful insights on global economic trends.
- **Relationship Identification**: Understand the relationships between life expectancy, GDP, and electricity consumption across different countries and regions.

## Key Insights
Based on the analysis, several important insights were uncovered:

1. **Electricity Drives Development**  
   There is a strong correlation between electricity consumption and economic development. Countries with higher electricity consumption tend to have higher productivity and economic growth rates.

2. **Life Expectancy Increases as Countries Become Richer**  
   As GDP per capita rises, life expectancy also tends to increase, suggesting that wealthier nations can afford better healthcare, nutrition, and living standards.

3. **GDP Growth has Been Exponential**  
   Global GDP has shown an exponential growth trend, driven by advancements in technology, industrialization, and increased access to resources and infrastructure.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: For data processing, analysis, and visualization.
- **Pandas & Matplotlib/Seaborn**: Used for data manipulation and creating visualizations.

## Data Analysis Steps
1. **Data Collection**: Compiled data on life expectancy, GDP, and electricity consumption from global datasets.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Ensured data accuracy by removing inconsistencies, handling missing values, and standardizing units where necessary.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted EDA to explore correlations and trends between variables.
4. **Visualization**: Created visualizations to illustrate the relationships and trends in the data.

## Conclusion
The project demonstrates clear links between economic development (measured by GDP), life expectancy, and electricity consumption. These insights highlight the importance of infrastructure and economic growth in improving living standards globally.
